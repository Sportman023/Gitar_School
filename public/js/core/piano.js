// The piano was recorded every minor third, so only eleven keys — D#3 to A5 —
// are stored in audio/piano/. A note in between is the nearest recording
// played a semitone faster or slower, which is inaudible on a piano.
// The range covers every octave the app teaches: E3-B3, C4-B4 and C5-G5.
// The recordings differ in loudness (the higher, the quieter). They are
// levelled on load, so volume never hints at which note it is.
